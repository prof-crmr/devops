# GitLab Lab Exercise: Managing Branches and Commits

## Objective
The objective of this Lab Exercise is to help a team learn how to use GitLab for version control and collaboration by creating a project, creating a branch, making commits to the branch, and eventually merging the changes to the master branch. The example scenario we will use is a team working on a web application called "AwesomeApp."

## Prerequisites
1. Basic understanding of Git concepts (e.g., repository, commit, branch, remote).
2. GitLab account and access to a project repository.

## Steps

### Step 1: Creating a Project
1. Go to GitLab (https://gitlab.com) and sign in to your account.
2. Create a new project by clicking on the "New Project" button.
3. Fill in the project details, such as name (e.g., "AwesomeApp") and description.
4. Choose the project's visibility (public or private) and configure any other settings as needed.
5. Click on the "Create project" button to create the project.

### Step 2: Cloning the Project Locally
1. Open your terminal or Git Bash.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
3. Copy the SSH or HTTPS URL of your GitLab project repository.
4. Run the following command to clone the project:

**git clone <repository_url>**


### Step 3: Creating a Branch
1. Navigate into the project directory using the terminal.
2. Create a new branch for your work using the following command:

**git checkout -b <branch_name>**

This command creates and switches to a new branch called "feature/new-feature."

### Step 4: Making Commits to the Branch
1. Open the project files in your preferred text editor or IDE.
2. Make the necessary changes or add new files to implement the new feature.
3. Save your changes and return to the terminal.
4. Run the following command to view the status of your changes:

**git status**

This command shows the modified files and the changes staged for commit.
5. Run the following command to stage your changes for commit:

**git add .**

This command stages all the changes you made.
6. Commit your changes with a descriptive message using the following command:

**git push origin <branch_name>**

This command sends your local branch and commits to the remote repository.
2. Visit your GitLab project page in a web browser and navigate to the "Branches" section.
3. You should see your newly created branch listed.
4. Click on the "Merge request" button next to your branch to start the merge request process.

### Step 6: Merging the Branch into the Master Branch
1. Review the changes in the merge request and add any necessary comments or discussions.
2. Assign the merge request to a team member for review.
3. Once the review is complete and any necessary changes are made, click on the "Merge" button.
4. Choose the "Merge when pipeline succeeds" option to ensure the changes pass any required tests or checks.
5. Click on the "Merge" button to merge the branch into the master branch.

Congratulations! You have successfully completed the Lab Exercise, learning how to create a project, create a branch, make commits, and merge changes using GitLab. This workflow is essential for effective collaboration and version control within a team.

## Git Commands

Below is a list of essential Git commands used in this Lab Exercise:

- `git clone <repository_url>`: Clone a remote repository to your local machine.
- `git checkout -b <branch_name>`: Create a new branch and switch to it.
- `git status`: View the status of your changes and the current branch.
- `git add .`: Stage all changes in the current directory for the next commit.
- `git commit -m "<commit_message>"`: Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message.
- `git push origin <branch_name>`: Push the local branch and commits to the remote repository.
- `git merge <branch_name>`: Merge a branch into the current branch (e.g., master branch).
- `git pull origin <branch_name>`: Pull the latest changes from the remote repository to your local branch.
