# Git Lab Excercise: Verifying Logs and Other Git Commands

## Objective
The objective of this Lab Excercise is to familiarize your team with additional Git commands for verifying logs, examining changes, and other helpful operations. The Lab Excercise will cover the following topics:
- Checking commit history and logs
- Examining changes with `git diff`
- Using `git blame` to track changes
- Utilizing various other Git commands for managing branches and repositories

## Prerequisites
1. Basic understanding of Git concepts (e.g., repository, commit, branch, remote).
2. Git installed on the team members' machines.

## Steps

### Step 1: Checking Commit History and Logs
1. Open your terminal or Git Bash.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run the following command to view the commit history:

**git log**

This will display a detailed log of commits, including the commit hash, author, date, and commit message.

### Step 2: Examining Changes with `git diff`
1. Make some changes to one or more files in your repository.
2. Run the following command to see the changes you made:

**git diff**

This will show a line-by-line comparison of the changes made since the last commit.

### Step 3: Using `git blame` to Track Changes
1. Open a file in your repository.
2. Run the following command to track changes made to each line of the file:

**git blame <file_name>**

This will show the commit hash, author, and date for each line in the file.

### Step 4: Utilizing Other Git Commands
Experiment with the following Git commands to explore additional features and operations:
- `git branch`: List branches in the repository.
- `git checkout <branch_name>`: Switch to the specified branch.
- `git remote -v`: List remote repositories and their URLs.
- `git fetch`: Fetch changes from a remote repository.
- `git tag <tag_name>`: Create a new tag for a specific commit.

Refer to the [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc) for more details on these commands and additional options.

Congratulations! You have successfully completed the Lab Excercise, exploring additional Git commands for verifying logs, examining changes, and managing repositories. These commands provide valuable insights into the history of your project and allow you to perform various operations effectively.
