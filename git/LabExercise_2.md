# GitLab Lab Exercise: Learning GitLab - Managing Branches and Commits, and Resolving Merge Conflicts

## Objective
The objective of this Lab Exercise is to help a team learn how to use GitLab for version control and collaboration. We will cover the following topics:
- Creating a project
- Creating a branch
- Making commits to a branch
- Merging changes to the master branch
- Resolving merge conflicts

## Prerequisites
1. Basic understanding of Git concepts (e.g., repository, commit, branch, remote).
2. GitLab account and access to a project repository.

## Steps

### Step 1: Creating a Project
1. Go to GitLab (https://gitlab.com) and sign in to your account.
2. Create a new project by clicking on the "New Project" button.
3. Fill in the project details, such as name (e.g., "AwesomeApp") and description.
4. Choose the project's visibility (public or private) and configure any other settings as needed.
5. Click on the "Create project" button to create the project.

### Step 2: Cloning the Project Locally
1. Open your terminal or Git Bash.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
3. Copy the SSH or HTTPS URL of your GitLab project repository.
4. Run the following command to clone the project:

### Step 3: Creating a Branch
1. Navigate into the project directory using the terminal.
2. Create a new branch for your work using the following command:
This command creates and switches to a new branch called "feature/new-feature."

### Step 4: Making Commits to the Branch
1. Open the project files in your preferred text editor or IDE.
2. Make the necessary changes or add new files to implement the new feature.
3. Save your changes and return to the terminal.
4. Run the following command to stage your changes for commit:
This command stages all the changes you made.
5. Commit your changes with a descriptive message using the following command:

### Step 5: Pushing Changes to the Remote Branch
1. Push your local branch to the remote repository using the following command:
This command sends your local branch and commits to the remote repository.
2. Visit your GitLab project page in a web browser and navigate to the "Branches" section.
3. You should see your newly created branch listed.
4. Click on the "Merge request" button next to your branch to start the merge request process.

### Step 6: Merging the Branch into the Master Branch
1. Review the changes in the merge request and add any necessary comments or discussions.
2. Assign the merge request to a team member for review.
3. Once the review is complete and any necessary changes are made, click on the "Merge" button.
4. Choose the "Merge when pipeline succeeds" option to ensure the changes pass any required tests or checks.
5. Click on the "Merge" button to merge the branch into the master branch.

### Step 7: Resolving Merge Conflict
1. Suppose another team member, Charlie, made conflicting changes in a different branch.
2. Attempt to merge Charlie's branch into the master branch:
3. Git will notify you of a merge conflict in one or more files. Open the files to see the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`).
4. Manually edit the files to resolve the conflicts by selecting the desired changes or combining them appropriately.
5. Stage the resolved files:
6. Continue the merge process:
Git will automatically generate a commit message for the merge.
7. Push the changes to the remote repository:

Congratulations! You have successfully completed the Lab Exercise, learning how to create a project, create a branch, make commits, merge changes, and resolve merge conflicts using GitLab. This workflow is essential for effective collaboration and version control within a team.
